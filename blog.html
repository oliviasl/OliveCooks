                <p>
                    Last Friday I made these vegetable buns (baos) with my two amigos
                    Pickle Xin and Noelle Crawfish. Although a meat filling probably
                    would have tasted better, these were a good vegetarian alternative.
                    These buns were pretty flavorless, so we had to eat them with soy sauce.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="row no-gutters">

                <p style="font-size:18px;">Pickle had a weird obsession with poking the buns... (look at those tiny fingers)</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The prep work was really tedious for this recipe because we had
                    to finely dice all of the filling ingredients. We did this while we
                    let our little dough boi rise from the yeast. We probably should've
                    added more salt and seasoning during this step. Next time I would add
                    more sugar and salt to the dough too.
                </p>

                    Folding the baos was the most difficult but my favorite part. Clearly
                    from the picture above you can see that the art of folding has
                    a large learning curve, but eventually I got the hang of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We tried to stuff as much filling as possible inside the baos
                    so they wouldn't fall over and be sadder than they already were.
                    Noelle also dumped way too much flour onto her board so her buns
                    were extra pale and dry (very sad).
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="ImageAssets/BlogImages/SteamedVegetableBaos/5.jpg" alt="Image">
                <p style="font-size:18px;">Look how fluffy he isssssss!</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We were very surprised when the baos actually turned out well.
                    The dough was fluffy (although bland) and the filling didn't leak
                    out while it was steamed. Even my ugly first attempt cooked well.
                    The satisfying tearing open of the baos made our long efforts worth
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I rated this recipe 5/10 because the final result looked pretty good
                    and folding the baos was fun. However, the score is
                    reduced by the blandness of the baos, partially
                    because meat filling usually tastes a lot better. But for a vegetarian
                    alternative, this recipe was a little better than I expected.
