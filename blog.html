                    I know that peach cobblers aren't Asian, but this is my blog
                    so I can do whatever the hell I want (imagine I said that in Pickle's southern accent lol).
                    This recipe isn't the classic peach cobbler with biscuit dough,
                    it better resembles a coffee cake with fruit baked in. Either way,
                    it tastes good because sugar always tastes good.

                <p>
                    I prepped the peaches by cutting an X in the skin and blanching them.
                    The satisfying moment of this recipe was peeling off the skin because
                    it all came off in one go, and the peach was so smooooooth. The dough was just
                    like cake dough, and I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top for some
                    extra crunchiness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cake rose a lot more than I was expecting, so I didn't add
                    enough peaches to balance it out. I also should've poured more of the sugary
                    peach syrup on top that was left over from coating the fruit in sugar and starch.

                    Even though I didn't add enough peaches, I'm still rating this an 8/10
                    because with the right ratio of fruit to cake and a little ice cream on top, it would be perfecto. Even
                    Yana finished a whole piece and she usually doesn't even eat food (I was very flattered).
                    I would definitely make this again, and I probably will in the next week.

                    For those who don't know what luffa (or loofah)
                    is, it's basically a Chinese gourd that people also use to make
                    exfoliating sponges (yummy!). My grandparents gave us a loofa and a bunch of
                    other veggies from their garden, so my mom and I decided to make a ton of soup with them.

                    Usually the recipe calls for luffa and tomatoes,
                    but we also added beans, onions, and zucchini. We always use the vegetarian
                    Better Than Bouillon soup base, which I 10/10 recommend for vegetarians.
                    We sliced and diced the veggies and dumped in some corn. After pressure
                    cooking the soup for a little, we swirled in some egg for some
                    nice egg drop (very satisfying to watch).

                    This recipe was a 6/10 because it makes you feel like a healthy bitch when
                    you eat it, but it's not very exciting to eat on its own.
                    For a veggie soup it tastes pretty good because we added a lot of ginger to the broth,
                    and it's very easy to make. Together with rice and kimchi, it's a
                    pretty solid meal.

                <p>
                    I decided to start off simple and make a classic dish: teriyaki chicken.
                    Although teriyaki sauce is associated with Japanese cuisine, it actually
                    originated in Hawaii when Japanese immigrants combined sweet pineapple and sugar
                    with savory soy sauce. Dishes like this one that use thick teriyaki glazes
                    are Asian American, while the term "teriyaki" refers to a method of traditional
                    fish preparation in Japan with a similar sweet and salty marinade.

                <br>
                <p>
                    When making this recipe, I sliced the chicken before cooking it instead
                    of the other way around like the video. I tossed the chicken in cornstarch before stir frying
                    it, but the cornstarch stuck to the pan because I didn't use enough oil and
                    formed an annoying film on the bottom. But all was fine,
                    because the sauce covered up all of the happy little accidents.

                    and it tasted really good! The balance of sweetness and saltiness was right
                    up my alley. Even when I didn't do the recipe perfectly, it still turned out
                    really well. I'd recommend this dish to beginner cooks or amateur cooks like myself.
                    Well, that's the review. Bawk bawk bois, I'm out.

                    Last Friday I made these vegetable buns (baos) with my two amigos
                    Pickle Xin and Noelle Crawfish. Although a meat filling probably
                    would have tasted better, these were a good vegetarian alternative.
                    These buns were pretty flavorless, so we had to eat them with soy sauce.

                <p>
                    The prep work was really tedious for this recipe because we had
                    to finely dice all of the filling ingredients. We did this while we
                    let our little dough boi rise from the yeast. I accidentally added
                    way too much white pepper to the filling and not enough soy sauce, so it
                    tasted kinda weird (but still kinda good). The recipe called for
                    wayyy too little seasoning, and it still ended up a little
                    bland after doubling the seasoning amounts. Next time I would add
                    more sugar and salt to the dough too.

                    Folding the baos was the most difficult but my favorite part. Clearly
                    from the picture above you can see that the art of folding has
                    a large learning curve, but eventually I got the hang of it.

                    We tried to stuff as much filling as possible inside the baos
                    so they wouldn't fall over and be sadder than they already were.
                    Noelle also dumped way too much flour onto her board so her buns
                    were extra pale and dry (very sad).

                    We were very surprised when the baos actually turned out well.
                    The dough was fluffy (although bland) and the filling didn't leak
                    out while it was steamed. Even my ugly first attempt cooked well.
                    The satisfying tearing open of the baos made our long efforts worth
                    it.

                    I rated this recipe 5/10 because the final result looked pretty good
                    and folding the baos was fun. However, the score is
                    reduced by the blandness of the baos, partially
                    because meat filling usually tastes a lot better. But for a vegetarian
                    alternative, this recipe was a little better than I expected.
